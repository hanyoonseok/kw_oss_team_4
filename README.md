0. Before start...
 - We hope you don't see this game as just one college team project.
 - Through this project, we were able to gain a lot of knowledge about OSS. This is a natural fact.
 - But this is not the only one. With C++ and SFML, we learned how to make images move, make sounds, and fire events we want on the screen.
 - We feel that the game is a huge and enormous art that combines music, art, and literature.
 - We may be able to stay at the basic level now, but I feel the most important fact that this team project has led us to reflect on our present, to think about our future, and to seriously think about what we should do.

1. SFML installation and library setup
 - We use the SFML library in this project!
 - The version of SFML is 2.5.1 version (32bit).
 - We have SFML library related settings in the project.
 - However, if SFML does not run smoothly, you may need to install SFML yourself.

2. Game description
 - This game is a basic level RPG.
 - However, it is not an RPG to defeat monsters or buy goods by collecting goods.
 - You will become a student at Kwangwoon University's Software Department and test our games.
 - Your game score is determined by measuring the time you finish all games!
 - Let's try to get a good score by being greedy for testing!
 
 
3. Instructions for operation
 - The cursor and character can be moved using the arrow keys on the keyboard.
 - You can run the game by selecting the item where the cursor is located using the Enter key, or you can go to the previous screen.
 - You can exit the game in progress and go to the main screen by using the Escape key.
